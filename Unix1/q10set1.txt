Unix1: Question 10

Look at the last few lines of the file
tail -n 5 < cuffdiff.txt

Pay attention to general numeric sort (-g) and string numberic sort (-n)

Sort file by log fold change (column 10), from highest to lowest, save in a new file called sorted.cuffdiff.out

sort -k 10 -g -r cuffdiff.txt | column -t > sorted.cuffdiff.out

sort file, print only first 100 lines, save in top100.sorted.cuffdiff.out
head -n 100 sorted.cuffdiff.out > top100.sorted.cuffdiff.out


Sort the file by log fold change, print out the top 100, print only first column. This will be a list of the genes with the largest change in expression. Make sure your list is sorted by gene name and is unique. Save this curated list in a file called differentially.expressed.genes.txt.

sort -k10gr cuffdiff.txt | head -n 100 | cut -f1 > differentially.expressed.genes.txt
can't use column transformed file? (does something with separation?)


figured it out! 
cut -d' ' -f1 top100.sorted.cuffdiff.out 
this is how you specify that deliminator is white space -d ' ' (put a space in there.
